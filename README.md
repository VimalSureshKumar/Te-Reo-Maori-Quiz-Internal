I've created a console application multichoice quiz on Te Reo Māori, in this quiz there are 3 levels with 10 questions each level. The questions are in English, but it asks the user for Māori translation and the user is only allowed to Enter 1, 2, 3 or 4 nothing else.
The user is to choose their desired level first. Then it clears the console making a fresh start to the level chosen. If the user enters in the correct number, they gain a point towards their score and is only allowed to proceed to the next level if achieved 70% and higher.
If the user enters an incorrect answer the console will beep indicating, the answer was incorrect. No points are deducted from their score but less likely to pass. If the user passes a level with 70%, they can move onto the next level or if the user has scored 70% on Extreme Level the user can try the quiz again to improve the score. However, the user manages to get under 70% the user can try the level again or exit the program. There are multiple places to exit the program.
When the user completes 3 levels, they are shown a congrats message and is given an option to restart to the Main menu to do the quiz again or the user can exit the program.
